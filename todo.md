Let me outline a detailed implementation plan specifically for our situation:

**Phase 1: Core Social Integration (Weeks 1-3)**
```typescript
const phase1 = {
    // 1. User System Enhancement
    auth: {
        implementation: {
            profiles: {
                username: string,
                email: string,
                friends: string[],
                currentlyPlaying?: {
                    songId: string,
                    startTime: number
                }
            },
            location: "MongoDB userDB (new free tier)",
            priority: "Week 1"
        }
    },

    // 2. KeyDB Setup on Contabo
    realtime: {
        setup: {
            directory: "/opt/keydb",
            config: {
                memory: "1GB",
                threads: 1,
                port: 6379
            },
            priority: "Week 1"
        }
    },

    // 3. Basic Social Features
    social: {
        features: [
            "Friend connections",
            "Currently playing status",
            "Basic activity feed"
        ],
        priority: "Week 2-3"
    }
}
```

**Phase 2: Tracking & Analytics (Weeks 4-6)**
```typescript
const phase2 = {
    // 1. Listening History
    tracking: {
        realtime: {
            storage: "KeyDB",
            metrics: [
                "Current session data",
                "Today's play counts",
                "Recent skips"
            ]
        },
        persistent: {
            storage: "MongoDB analyticsDB",
            metrics: [
                "Daily summaries",
                "Favorite genres",
                "Listening patterns"
            ]
        },
        priority: "Week 4"
    },

    // 2. Friend Activity
    activity: {
        features: [
            "Friend listening feed",
            "Shared music history",
            "Common favorites"
        ],
        priority: "Week 5"
    },

    // 3. Basic Recommendations
    recommendations: {
        types: [
            "Friend-based suggestions",
            "Genre affinity matching",
            "Time-of-day preferences"
        ],
        priority: "Week 6"
    }
}
```

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-9)**
```typescript

        features: {
            listening: "Synchronized playback",
            chat: "Session-based messaging",
            queue: "Collaborative queue"
        },
        priority: "Week 7"
